      <![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">We sat down with Irene Forte to discuss her style, wellness routine and skincare favourites. With her ‘Natura e Scienza’ vision, Irene Forte is the founder, leader and driving force behind Irene Forte Skincare. As the Wellness Consultant of Rocco Forte Hotels and an Advisory Board Member of the Global Wellness Summit, Irene has always understood the importance of a holistic approach to beauty. This is reflected in her constant emphasis on nourishing, organic ingredients. However, natural ingredients alone don’t guarantee results, so Irene has married nature with science to make it possible for the latest scientific understanding to drive product performance.</span></i></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0030/0158/1668/files/Irene_Forte_2_480x480.jpg?v=1633948700" alt=""></p>
<p>Tell me about you / your business?<br><br></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I'm an Italian that was born / grew up in London. I worked in my family's hotel business for almost a decade before setting up my skincare line, <a href="https://ireneforteskincare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Irene Forte Skincare</a>. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Characterised as ‘Natural Science’, Irene Forte Skincare is all about achieving outstanding results with natural ingredients. Our formulations are shaped by 35 years of skincare research and development thanks to my amazing Scientific Director, Dr. Francesca Ferri. Together, we've introduced novel ingredients in products which have shown outstanding activity in independent clinical trials. For all Irene Forte products, the core ingredients come from Verdura Resort's organic farm in Sicily (a place that lies close to my heart). Alongside these, we've integrated zero-waste upcycled ingredients, made from nutrient-rich plant-based leftovers; all of our ingredients are vegan. Indeed, sustainability is a primary business focus for us and something that I built into the DNA of my business from the beginning. </span></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0030/0158/1668/files/Irene_Forte_4_480x480.jpg?v=1633948806" alt=""></p>
<p>Describe your style?</p>
<p> I'm a conservative dresser and like to be comfortable. I love high-waisted skirts and flares. I love colours and prints. I also like to be in gym gear whenever it's acceptable! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>How do you workout each week?</p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I’ve always been relatively ‘sporty’ and I’ve tried not to lose that since leaving school (a long time ago now). I tend to work out 4 times a week. One session will be just cross-trainer because I tend to be short of time. I’m a member of Equinox so I tend to do a mix of different high-Intensity interval training classes there; this includes Tabata, Boxing and Barry’s style running classes. I might also mix this up with some Reformer Pilates at Heartcore and some Barre at Barrecore. On a beautiful day, I’ll run in Kensington Park Gardens.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>How do you recharge/ clear your head / stay focused ?</p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I think the most important thing for me is sleep. I sleep 8.5 hours per night. ‘<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-We-Sleep-Science-Dreams/dp/0141983760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why We Sleep’ by Matthew Walke</a>r was a great book that helped me understand the importance of sleep. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">A healthy and balanced diet is also key for me. I follow a Mediterranean diet, which is widely believed to be the cleanest, healthiest and most balanced diet in the world, associated with good health and longevity. It is not about faddy trends and unsustainable eating habits (just like my skincare). </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I also love to have regular treatments. I like all sorts of treatments; they help me unwind, recharge and relax. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">And lastly, I would say regular exercise, vital for good health, and for me to stay sane. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>What is a trusted quote or advice you live by?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Treat others as you would like to be treated. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where are you dreaming of travelling to and how will you pack?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Being Italian by blood, I adore travelling to Italy. Be it Rome, Florence, the Tuscan countryside, Puglia, Venice... the list is endless. In particular, I’m extremely attached to Sicily. I fell in love with the island when I worked for our resort, Verdura, for six months in 2006. Its landscapes, culture, food, people, and sense of family are unrivaled. So, I'm dreaming of traveling to Sicily. </p>
<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0030/0158/1668/files/Irene_Forte_1_480x480.jpg?v=1633948911" alt=""><br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">In terms of what I would pack: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">- Lots of <a href="https://xhtng2qgiuidsfh8-3001581668.shopifypreview.com/collections/new-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucas Hugh</a>, as I'm always active there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">- Some <a href="https://www.lido-lido.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lido swimwear </a>(sustainable and entirely made in Venice). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">- Some <a href="https://oliviavonhalle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia von Halle</a> silk pyjamas; they are my essential travel companions for a good night’s sleep, no matter what season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">- My new <a href="https://ireneforteskincare.co.uk/products/rigeneranti-essenziali-kit?_pos=1&amp;_sid=4646ad992&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Essenziali Rigeneranti Kit,</a> which contains Irene Forte Skincare's six regenerating hero products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">- It’s so important to always wear SPF and I never travel without my <a href="https://eltamd.com/products/eltamd-uv-clear-tinted-broad-spectrum-spf-46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eltaMD clear tinted</a> broad-spectrum one. It’s a lightly tinted facial sunscreen and is great as a make-up base alternative. What’s more, it's paraben and phthalate-free and is rich in hyaluronic acid and vitamin E – basically skin food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">- I’m not a big make-up person, but <a href="https://www.rmsbeauty.com/products/un-cover-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RMS’s "Un" Cover-Up concealer</a> is great when paired with my<a href="https://eltamd.com/collections/tinted-sunscreen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Elta-MD tinted facial sunscreen</a>. The concealer is a skin-perfecting, illuminating concealer that I use under my eyes, lightly applying it with my ring finger. I love this because it’s clean and doesn’t dry out the skin under my eyes.</span></p>
<p>Favourite beauty essential or treatment?</p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I don’t have one favourite beauty essential or treatment. However, I would say there are three beauty products that I can’t live without. They are part of my Irene Forte Skincare Myoxinol™ regime: Hibiscus Serum, Prickly Pear Face Cream and Hibiscus Night Cream. Alongside each other in clinical trials, the Hibiscus Serum, Prickly Pear Face Cream and Hibiscus Night Cream deliver visible wrinkle reduction that gets more and more noticeable the longer the products are used. </span></p>
<p>Do you have a recommended book/ podcast or show?</p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">I love the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shoe-Dog-Memoir-Creator-NIKE/dp/1471146723/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=book+Shoe+Dog+by+Phil+Knight&amp;qid=1633948258&amp;qsid=261-8621873-4094626&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-4&amp;sres=9124072605%2C9124079553%2C9124068349%2C1471146723%2C9124072559%2C9000357594%2C9123963018%2C9124072575%2C9123963026%2C912407232X%2C9124038245%2C9123979666%2C9123913053%2C9123913037%2C9124072567%2C154841705X&amp;srpt=ABIS_BOOK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">book Shoe Dog by Phil Knight</a> who created Nike. He is a case in point that success isn’t handed to you, his story is amazing.</span></p>
<p>Favourite pieces from the Lucas Hugh collection? </p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">It's actually the only workout clothing that I wear. It's the absolute best. The <a href="https://xhtng2qgiuidsfh8-3001581668.shopifypreview.com/products/performance-v2-leggings-black?_pos=1&amp;_sid=d85e17b5e&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance V2 leggings</a> are the most flattering workout leggings I've ever worn. </span></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Are the over 40’s now as hip as 20-year-olds?  </p><p><a class="read-more" href="https://www.lucashugh.com/blogs/the-fit/age-is-just-a-number">More</a></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Susannah Taylor asks the question, is age now irrelevant in modern society?</p>
<hr>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last August, the cult US beauty and health magazine Allure magazine released a statement saying they were changing their narrative around growing older and that they were banning the phrase ‘anti-ageing.’ Editor, Michelle Lee explained the decision, saying “Whether we know it or not we are subtly reinforcing the message that ageing is a condition we need to battle.” It was the beginning of an avalanche of other beauty businesses following suit who are, as a result, now putting a more positive spin on the inevitability and brilliance of age.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This turn-around by the beauty industry hasn’t landed out of thin air – it’s reflective of the way women over 40 now live life today. As a fit 42-year-old myself, the term ‘middle-aged’ feels like the ultimate insult. I don’t wear support knickers or sensible shoes with soft soles (apart from my Nike Fly-Knits or YSL trainers), and I don’t have a predictable over-40 easy-style haircut. I’m fitter than I’ve ever been in my life (and probably look better in a bikini for it) and I often wear leggings and trainers like my 11-year-old daughter does yet somehow never feel like mutton dressed as lamb. I don’t do coffee mornings, Tupperware parties or elasticated waistbands. Hell, I don’t even iron my sheets let alone my husband’s boxer shorts like my mother before me.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The generation gap, it seems is closing, we forty-plus women look, feel and live differently than our forbearers. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wear jeans and trainers to work, spend as much time as our daughters on Instagram and shop with them in &amp;OtherStories. For the first time in history more women are having children in their forties than under 20 (I am one of them, I am currently pregnant) and a recent study of more than 500 women by marketing agency SuperHuman found that 80 percent felt that society’s assumptions about ‘middle-aged’ women does not represent how we actually live our lives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For too long it feels that the focus has been on Team Millennial, but this perception is shifting and the ‘The Perennials’ are claiming ground especially in the workplace. Statistics estimate that by 2020 up to a third of the UK workforce will be 50 plus and control 80 percent of the wealth. Alice Olins of The Step-up Club, a business that helps women find career success says, “</span><span class="s2">We’re living longer and staying younger than ever before, so it’s not surprising that barriers around age at work are coming down. Now that we're likely to work into our 70s, at 40 we’re not even halfway through our careers.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0030/0158/1668/files/lucashugh_magazine_ageless-768x512_large.jpg?v=1555576415" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span>Photo by Mario Sorrenti, Prada Fall '18, Isabelle Marant Fall '18. At 44, Amber Valetta continues to dominate the modelling world. </span></h5>
<p> Whilst we may be working longer, however, doesn’t mean we don’t wish for the crease-free skin, and grey-less hair we had in our 20s explains <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nadinebaggott/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadine Baggott</a>, a 55-year-old journalist and YouTuber for beauty grown-ups, but “With age comes a wisdom and a sense of peace with your imperfections, and that is truly powerful.” We are a generation ultimately comfortable in our own skin, and that is coolness personified, surely.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Francesca White ruminates on how activewear has become a necessary extension of her ready-to-wear closet.</p><p><a class="read-more" href="https://www.lucashugh.com/blogs/the-fit/activewear-as-ready-to-wear">More</a></p>]]>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>In case you’ve not noticed, activewear is now a thing. Gone are the days when we would rock up to the gym in an oversized t-shirt and old trainers: today’s kit has been designed not just to be functional - but to offer versatility, comfort and style. After all, you might be doing a punishing number of burpees in your sweat-wicking ensemble, but there’s a high chance that you’re staying in it for the rest of the day. So it needs to perform at all levels.</p>
<p>Fabric is key; <a href="https://lucashugh.com/collections/technical-knit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">designed to stretch</a> (crucial when you’re downward-dogging) but also <a href="https://lucashugh.com/collections/bonded-performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compress</a> (so everything is held firmly in the right place). Hi-tech varieties are woven with silver fibres (anti-bacterial); their stitching invisible, their seams taped.</p>
<p>Activewear also needs to make us feel good. It needs to cling in the right places (cue hidden corsetry), and make our thighs look slimmer (hello, leg-lengthening panels). It should be supportive (under-bust bands), practical (secret pockets) but also fun. Nothing brings some pizazz to a workout like a pair of glow-in-the-dark leggings.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0030/0158/1668/files/lucashugh_thefit_activewear-768x512_large.jpg?v=1555501296" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Hans Feurer for Vogue Russia, Getty Images</h5>
<p>My <a href="https://lucashugh.com/collections/one-pieces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucas Hugh one-piece</a>, with its bottom-sculpting powers, its soft boning, and its panels of swirling gold takes me from a barre class at KXU, to brunch at Colbert (throw a cropped sweater, sparkly Nikes and a puffy Moncler on top and you’re good to go). I’m tempted to pair it with a Barbour and a slick of neon lipstick, then wear it to a festival – though it would be a nightmare to get on and off in the portaloos. It would look positively soigné with a pair of heels and a tuxedo for supper.</p>
<p>Frankly, the reason I can’t get out of my gym kit is because it’s so easygoing. Just don’t say I’m not dressed for the occasion. </p>

<hr>
<p>Since launching Lucas Hugh in 2010, Anjhe Mules is well versed in styling activewear both in and out of the gym. Known for her smart styling of ready-to-wear with activewear, Anjhe shares how she styles looks from the newly launched SS19 release.</p>

<p>AS A CREATIVE DIRECTOR AND A DESIGNER, WHERE ARE YOU CURRENTLY DRAWING STYLING INSPIRATION FROM?</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Like our customer, I travel frequently and use my experiences abroad to inform how we design for an international woman. Having just returned from holiday in South Africa, I’ve come back to London feeling inspired by the bold and colourful activewear styling of Cape Town women. I was energized by the confident looks women were wearing to high-intensity classes like </span><a href="https://www.sweat1000.com/">Sweat 1000</a><span> and </span><a href="http://www.switchplayground.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweat Playground</a><span>. </span></p>
<p><br>HOW DO YOU APPROACH STYLING ACTIVEWEAR WITH READY-TO-WEAR? <br>I am in meetings a lot and for this reason I am more comfortable in tailored styles, with technical accents. I like to pair a tailored jacket or oversized blouse with fitted leggings or a bodysuit for contrast. I love shoes and have lots of sneakers. Being able to move quickly and comfortably also informs how I build an outfit.<br><br>LOOK 1: TRAINING KIT<br>I have recently integrated boxing into my weekly fitness training. I prefer morning workouts, combining strength training at<span> </span><a href="https://twentytwotraining.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twenty Two Training</a> with boxing classes at<span> </span><a href="http://www.whitecityhouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White City House</a>. <br>I like to style the<span> </span><a href="https://www.lucashugh.com/shop/axis-crop-tank-sapphire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axis Crop</a>, our low-mid impact<span> </span><a href="https://www.lucashugh.com/shop/technical-knit-sports-bra-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technical Knit Sports Bra</a> with the<span> </span><a href="https://www.lucashugh.com/shop/axis-leggings-sappire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axis Leggings</a><span> </span>in the new seasonal colour Black/Sapphire.

The seasonal fabric is a technical material that offers a luxurious look with the soft hand-feel of satin.</p>

<p><span>I find myself wearing the </span><a href="https://www.lucashugh.com/shop/satin-bomber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Satin Bomber </a><span>zipped-up with paired with a medium-wash straight-leg </span><a href="https://www.modaoperandi.com/slvrlake-denim-r19/london-straight-leg-jeans?utm_source=criteo&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=retarget-uk-new-lowerfunnel&amp;utm_content=evergreen-300x600&amp;promo=RT10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slvrlake jeans</a><span> and my white </span><a href="https://www.net-a-porter.com/gb/en/product/1112738" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acne leather sneakers</a><span>. This style is quite casual for me and definitely one for the weekend or a work day without meetings.<br><br></span>LOOK 3: EVENING OUT<br>I am often asked how activewear can be styled for special occasions.

      <![CDATA[<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>Gym make-up is a hot topic amongst my girlfriends. Would you, wouldn’t you, a little here, no not even a touch there…hours have been lost deep in discussion I tell you. Perhaps it’s the beauty editor in me, but wearing makeup to the gym has always been a bugbear of mine. Even if my class falls at the end of the day, a quick once-over (or maybe twice, double cleanse and all) with my face wash, is a must.</p>
<p>I’ve never really preached to others about ‘training clean’ until I was given the task to write this piece. I started thinking about it more so than ever before, and when you do, trust me you second guess why you’d ever wear slap to sweat. You’re practically shielding your skin with layers of products when all it wants to do is breath a happy dance of the day's toxins. Spots and breakouts, of course, they’d be inevitable, not to mention mascara halfway down your face.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0030/0158/1668/files/lucashugh_cleantraining-2-768x512_large.jpg?v=1555510317" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>But if you're not comfortable going completely bare, follow these top tips:</p>
<p>/ Keep it light - especially your moisturiser. Anything too thick, greasy or oily with only lead to breakouts. <a href="https://www.clinique.co.uk/product/21350/50976/cliniquefit/cliniquefittm-post-workout-mattifying-moisturizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CliniqueFit Post-Workout Mattifying Moisturize</a>r (£26) keeps oil at bay with an 8-hour promise.</p>
<p>/ Enhance alternative features…like your brows. <a href="https://www.sportsdirect.com/sportfx-shape-up-brow-pencil-758092" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SportFX Shape Up Brow Pencil</a>, (£7.99) won't drip or slip no matter how many burpees you push through.</p>
<p>/ Prevent shine - if you avoid group exercising because your face turns a sweet shade of tomato try <a href="https://www.murad.co.uk/matteffect-blotting-perfector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Murad Mattieffect Blotting Perfector Mattifier</a>, (£32) - it reduces flushing, fast.</p>
<p>/ Invest in a great mascara- fibre formulas tend to stay put much more so than any waterproof version I’ve tried. Kevyn Aucoin, The Volume Mascara (£23) requires a dousing of warm water to remove, and your good to go.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>WHAT WAS THE INSPIRATION AND JOURNEY BEHIND THE DESIGN CHASER?</p>
<p>My love of interiors was ignited while working for a large magazine publisher here in NZ. I became obsessed with the home magazines and when I left to start a family I started reading interior blogs. I remember saying to my husband that I’d love to start a blog one day. In the meantime, I joined Pinterest which helped me hone in on my love of Nordic design. Surprised to see my following take off, I also gained confidence seeing my style resonating with others. The blog felt like a natural progression where I could put my voice to what I was sharing. When we embarked on our home build I started documenting the journey on the blog, carrying out my own styling and photography to share on Instagram. My audience responded really well to seeing my interior design plans come to life and brands started reaching out to collaborate. Styling has now become my favourite arm of the business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0030/0158/1668/files/the_design_chaser_thefit_3_large.jpg?v=1552860141" style="float: none;"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>DO YOU THINK A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF NAIVETY IS HELPFUL WHEN STARTING OUT ON YOUR OWN?</p>
<p>I’ve never thought of it that way but yes, probably!</p>
<p>I didn’t set out with any high expectations but I absolutely loved what I was doing, and blogging became very addictive. I worked really hard and put in some crazy hours around looking after my young boys. Seeing that I was inspiring others was hugely motivating and before I knew it, it had morphed into a business. I still get excited when opportunities come along, big or small.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Listening to my gut and staying true to my brand and aesthetic is really important. As is taking time out to recharge the batteries."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ON REFLECTION, WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR BIGGEST LESSONS?</p>
<p>Working from home on your own can be quite isolating so it’s important to take the time out to meet up with other creatives to discuss work and bounce ideas off one another. Keeping up with the blog, social media and collaborations is a big job for one person and I have learnt the hard way with burnout. I am now learning not to overcommit, and to say no. Listening to my gut and staying true to my brand and aesthetic is really important. As is taking time out to recharge the batteries.</p>
<p>WHAT CREATIVES ARE YOU MOST INSPIRED BY?</p>
<p>Because most of my inspiration comes from Scandinavia, I look to the leading interior designers, stylists, product designers and architects in that region for direction and inspiration. Too many to name!</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0030/0158/1668/files/DC-4_large.jpg?v=1552855766" style="float: none;"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHO ARE YOUR FAVOURITE HOMEWARE BRANDS?</p>
<p>Danish design, in particular, is a firm favourite. This was further cemented last year when I travelled to Copenhagen courtesy of the renowned Danish furniture brand Erik Jørgensen. Other favourites include Menu, Montana, Muuto and &amp;Tradition.</p>
<p>WHAT IS LIFE LIKE AT THE MOMENT?</p>
<p>Busy but fun. I’m working with some great local and global brands and I have several shoots coming up which I’m excited about.</p>
<p>FIVE YEARS FROM NOW, WHAT WILL THE DESIGN CHASER LOOK LIKE?</p>
<p>A bigger online platform and a physical studio specialising in interior styling and photography services</p>]]>

    </author>
    <summary type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p>The Fit sat down with our very own Anjhe Mules, Founder and Creative Director of Lucas Hugh to talk about how she took The Fitting Room, Lucas Hugh’s exciting new retail space, from concept to creation ahead of its opening on the Kings Road in Chelsea this month. </p><p><a class="read-more" href="https://www.lucashugh.com/blogs/the-fit/introducing-the-fitting-room">More</a></p>]]>
    </summary>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>HOW DID YOU DECIDE WHERE TO SET UP SHOP?</p>
<p><span>As we do when designing new styles, we asked our customers first and it soon became clear that Chelsea was the best fit. The location on the Kings Road is great – right amongst some excellent fitness studios and the beautiful stores of Sloane Street and Duke of York Square, and of course the Saatchi Gallery. Needless to say, we’re in the best company.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0030/0158/1668/files/storefront-768x512_large.jpg?v=1555500425" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p>
<p>WHAT IS THE STRATEGY BEHIND THE FITTING ROOM 8 MONTH TIMELINE? </p>
<p><span>Launching in May during the beautiful London springtime and carrying through to the new year means we are able to showcase two new seasonal collections and exclusive drops, making the most of the summer and holiday period. As a digitally native brand, opening our first retail space affords Lucas Hugh the opportunity to develop our retail model with our customer to ensure it performs to meet her needs.</span></p>
<p>HOW DOES THE FITTING ROOM OFFER CONSUMERS AN INNOVATIVE RETAIL EXPERIENCE? </p>
<p><span>For us, we aren’t looking to reinvent the wheel. Instead, we want to refine the retail experience to what we consider to be right for the Lucas Hugh customer. </span><span>A big focus for The Fitting Room is experience and service – having knowledgeable staff who not only understand our product but can also offer insider knowledge and access for the wellness woman in the area. </span><span>We also wanted to create a space where the customer feels welcome to linger whether it’s to browse, have a tailored fitting experience or simply just chat. To create this feeling, we outfitted two-thirds of the space with lounge seating and three comfortable fit rooms. The space will also be the only location that offers the full assortment of both seasonal and core styles as well as product exclusives.</span></p>
<p>WHAT CHALLENGES DID YOU FACE WHEN DESIGNING THE NEW STORE CONCEPT?</p>
<p><span>Our biggest challenge was working with a semi-permanent space that we knew we had to outfit within a short amount of time. When designing the space, I focused on how I could make the features as packable as possible while still maintaining that luxury feel. As with most things, there was some compromise involved but I think we succeeded in bringing the concept to creation!</span></p>
<p><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0030/0158/1668/files/materials-768x512_large.jpg?v=1555500503" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p>
<p>WHAT WAS YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND THE DESIGN, WHAT MATERIALS AND COLOUR USED?</p>
<p><span>Futurism is a constant inspiration to me and is the foundation of the Lucas Hugh design identity. I wanted this DNA to flow through into the store in a way that was dynamic and luxurious. Geometric lines are a feature throughout the space, from the flooring to the garment rails and fit rooms. The materials and colours selected also speak to this, perspex fittings and metallic finishings are grounded by lush carpet in the lounge and fitting area.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0030/0158/1668/files/thefit_design_1-768x512_large.jpg?v=1555500456" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p>
<p>WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR LUCAS HUGH IN THE BRICK AND MORTAR SPACE?</p>
<p><span>We are very much using this 8-month lease to connect with our customer and learn her needs and wants from a Lucas Hugh retail space. Think of The Fitting Room as Lucas Hugh retail in beta mode.</span></p>
